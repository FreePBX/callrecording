"Asterisk 13.2 and higher supports the ability to play a regular 'beep' when "
"a call is being recorded. If you set this to a positive number value, when a "
"call is being actively recorded, both parties will hear a 'beep' every "
"period that you select. If you are not running Asterisk 13.2 or higher, this "
"setting will have no effect. To disable simply clear the value of this box "
